			<p>People often think of job satisfaction as a spectrum, with happiness on one end and unhappiness on the other:</p>

			<p>In this view, how happy one will be at a job can be determined by “adding up” all of the tangibles (salary, benefits, workplace environment, etc) of that particular position and seeing how far they collectively move the needle on the spectrum. Because it’s cumulative, the lack of certain elements (like a good manager, for example) can be compensated for by increases in other elements (more salary, better perks). It makes for a mostly intuitive linear formula. And we know that the absence of things like an adequate salary, generous benefits, a respectable title, and so on are known to cause unhappiness, so it’s only logical to look for a surplus of those things to bring happiness… right?</p>
